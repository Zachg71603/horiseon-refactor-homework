# horiseon-refactor-homework

This project is my first homework challenge in the Cal Berkeley coding bootcamp, and my first project at all personally. The goal was to take the existing code of a website, and improve upon it whle keeping the visual aspect of the website the same. The main aspects of the code I found could be improved were repeteive css, missing image alts, semantic elements, and a descriptive title just to highlight a few. 
As someone new to developing, and this being my first project, I learned a lot during the course of working through this challenge. It is very easy to make the whole website crash, so it is important to not get discouraged and to use the reasources available to you.
